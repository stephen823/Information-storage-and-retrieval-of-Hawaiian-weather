# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Project Intro/Objective
This project's purposes include retrieving Hawaii's temperature and precipitation data utilizing SQLAlchemy and storing them in a Flask powered JSON dataset. Furthermore, I made use of Matplotlib to analyze Hawaii weather patterns via data visualization.



### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization


### Technologies
* Python
* Matplotlib
* Pandas, jupyter
* SQLAlchemy
* SQL
* Flask
* JSON


## Project Description
After accessing the dataset via SQLAlchemy, SQL queries are executed through python to organize data based on its variables. The reorganized data is then deployed as a JSON dataset through the use of the Flask app for future users to access. Additionally, I also utilized Maplotlib to visualize data and uncover crucial patterns of Hawaii weather.
